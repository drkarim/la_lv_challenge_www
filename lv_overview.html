  <h2 class="page-header">Datasets</h2>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <div class="well well-lg">The image database consisted of 30 multicenter, multivendor LGE CMR images of both humans and porcine. The human patient dataset was acquired at 1.5T and consisted of patients with known history of ischaemic cardiomyopathy and under assessment for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary and secondary preventions after infarction. The porcine dataset was acquired at 3T and consisted of images with lesions induced using the left-anterior descending or left-circum ex artery. </div>
